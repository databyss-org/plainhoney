		<description><![CDATA[Peaty, I noticed that your division between the Church and the Modern Museum parallels, and not incidentally, the division I spoke about in my essay /j-r/on-the-use-and-abuse-of-cleavage/&lt;/a&gt;, that between a religious and secular ritualism or ideology. I did briefly mention Deleuze&#039;s theory of the baroque church as a &#039;field&#039; that pulls the visitor (viewer) into a 2nd plane, a transcendent one, which I think is what you emphasize with your question about the &quot;ivory tower&quot; and &quot;aesthetic transcendence&quot;.  It is interesting though, since I transitioned in my essay from the church to cleavage, to remain glued to the standpoint of architecture as it continues to offer a sacred experience in its modern (postmodern? -- I know one babyvitruvius who says architecture can never become postmodern) form. Though of course I think you were being quite nice, or nicer than I would be about these places. And you weren&#039;t even being that nice ;)]]></description>
