		<description><![CDATA[@Peaty, indeed with the buttocks. However, though I imagine lineage can easily be fanned out beyond my frame (mainly Renaissance to Baroque), I would decline the &quot;Bikini Girls&quot;. They seem to lack the depth, I mean by they &#039;their breasts&#039;, that I am looking for, and as such, the ever-suggestive vertical shade of black. I wonder what it says though that that shading is very evident in the buttocks far before it is in the breasts. Perhaps sublimation as you suggest, or at least transvaluation, both of which are interesting to think about in relation to fashion.

		<description><![CDATA[While these Baroque depictions evidence a rupture within the site of cleavage as a &quot;wish-image&quot;, it might simultaneously be fruitful to deploy this site as an historic bridge to the past. Bridges are bi-direcitonal, after all. In particular, how would J.R. regard the infamous 4th Century (AD) &quot;Sala delle Dieci Ragazze&quot; mosaics (aka &quot;Bikini Girls&quot;) found in the Villa Romana del Casale in Sicily? Might this offer an earlier example of proto-cleavage than Leonardo&#039;s &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, and what of the notion that frontal cleavage could represent a sublimated reversal and/or projection of the posterior (aka buttocks) upon frontal iconography?
